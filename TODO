Static Checker:

[V] progress bar for pg queries
[V] "commander" command line parsing
[ ] command line one-shot usage
[V] fix view caching/checking
[ ] change view exceptions to ErrorDiagnostic
[ ] "hold" system for blocking/releasing updates when promise is running async. also maybe "cancellation token" system (for prematurely stopping currently running async task -- don't stop migrations or views, only stop queries)
[/] Integrate into VSCode (custom plugin, or figure out how to integrate command line --watch program to highlight errors; problem matchers: <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks>)

Run-time Library:

[ ] Connection wrapper object (conn.query, conn.queryOne, conn.queryOneOrNone)
[ ] insert DSL
      conn.insertOne("employee",
          {
              fname: sql`${"alice"}`,
              lname: sql`fname || ${"johnson"}`
          }, sql`RETURNING id`);

      conn.insertMany("employee",
          [{
              id: sql`${}`,
              fname: sql`${}`,
              lname: sql`${fname} || fname`
          }], sql`RETURNING id`);
[ ] migrations runner (algorithm:
    no un-applied migration files? just "CREATE OR REPLACE" all of the views (for performance: maybe all concatenated together as one huge string?)
    otherwise: try applying un-applied migration(s) file. did it work? great!
      otherwise, did we get error "2BP01" or "0A000"?
        yes: regex match "view xxxx" from "detail" and "DROP VEW xxxx CASCADE" (very carefully verifying via "pg_class" that xxxx is a view, not a table!). then try the migration(s) again (recursively if necessary)
        no: drop all of our views (view_foo_yyyyyy), then try again
    finally: "CREATE OR REPLACE" all of the views.

Nice-to-have:

[ ] automatically launch temporary postgres server
[ ] Emit error when an unnamed column ("?column?") is returned


Create temporary database:

$ initdb -D /tmp/test_sql -N -U test -W
$ postgres -F -D /tmp/test_sql -p 6432 -s

$ psql -h localhost -p 6432 -U test postgres
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE test WITH OWNER=test TEMPLATE=template0 ENCODING='UTF8' LC_COLLATE='en_US.utf8' LC_CTYPE='en_US.utf8';
